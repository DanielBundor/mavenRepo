# mavenRepo

## This is a pretty striaght-forward repo involving my maven projects. I had initially gone on to directly push my commits to the main branch of which I had done on purpose out of curiosity to see what it would look like working directly with the main branch, which I have used as production environment for other repositories.

## However, I look forward to improving and getting better as I move on with more practice; develop my job-ready skills as a DevOps Engineer.

## Thank you!
